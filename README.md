To use this this python robot framework for api testing, we need to do some set of installations.
And need to add library files WebServiceLib, TestUtil which are customized using python in site-packages folder.
Here we have used csv files for data.
And I have provided execution commands in project itself.
We are maintaining seperate folders for payloads, data, xls files for uploading.
.arg files for prepared api arguments
.validate file for response validation
Robot files for test cases.
run.py is using for data driven.
Using Robot framework reports generation.
Provided bactch files to execute.
Note : For all api's I used mock data setup.
Environment details also we can gin in csv file.
Used Batch files for execution from where ever we want.
